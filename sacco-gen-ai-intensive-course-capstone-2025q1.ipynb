This data, usually captured in Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) PDF documents, must be painstakingly re-entered, creating tedious and error-prone work. Additionally, employees often find it challenging to choose the most suitable medical, dental, or vision plan because comparing detailed benefits across multiple documents can be confusing. As a result, decisions frequently default to cost rather than overall value.\n","\n","Generative AI (GenAI) can address these pain points effectively by utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). With a RAG-based system, SBC documents are ingested and embedded into a vector store at plan creation time. Employees can then interact through a user-friendly chat interface during open enrollment, asking specific questions about each plan. The system can dynamically generate comparison tables or personalized recommendations based on individual needs. This project illustrates how leveraging GenAI capabilities learned in this course can significantly simplify and improve benefits plan selection.\n","\n","## Goal\n","This notebook demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline leveraging Generative AI (Google Gemini) to extract structured, meaningful data from uploaded SBC PDFs, enabling easy and transparent comparison of insurance plans. Furthermore, this can serve as an example for any industry that relies heavily on PDF documents to share information with its clients. The objective is to illustrate what's possible with this use case that is easily extended to others.\n","\n","### Gen AI Capabilities Utilized\n","\n","-   **Embeddings & Vector Store:** Utilized `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` to create vector representations of SBC document text chunks, storing them in a `Chroma` vector database for efficient retrieval.\n","-   **Vector Search/Vector Store/Vector Database:** Employed `Chroma` as a vector database and performed similarity searches (`store.similarity_search`) to find document chunks relevant to specific queries (including a multi-query approach).\n","-   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) & Grounding:** Implemented a multi-query RAG pipeline that retrieves relevant document chunks (context) from the vector store and provides this context to an LLM, instructing it to base its answers *only* on this retrieved information, ensuring grounded responses.\n","-   **Document Understanding:** Processed PDF documents (SBCs) using `PyMuPDF`, extracted text content, and used the LLM to interpret this text to extract specific data points based on context.\n","-   **Structured Output (JSON mode/controlled generation):** Engineered detailed prompts, including schema definitions and strict formatting rules, to guide the LLM in generating responses formatted as valid JSON objects containing extracted SBC details.\n","-   **Few-Shot Prompting:** Included a concrete example of the desired JSON output structure within the LLM prompt to improve the accuracy and formatting of the generated response based on the provided context.\n","\n","Let's get started and for any issues don't hesitate to contact me directly through my Kaggle [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/lousacco)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ad829381","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.003581,"end_time":"2025-04-18T19:44:52.997052","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-18T19:44:52.993471","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Set-up SDK and Packages\n","\n","The first step is to set-up the SDK and include the required packages I'll use throughout this notebook.

Better retrieval accuracy is crucial for RAG, as it ensures more relevant context is provided to the language model, leading to more accurate and complete answers.\n","2.  **Stability and General Availability:** While experimental models (`models/gemini-embedding-exp-*`) might offer potentially higher performance based on recent research, they lack the stability guarantees of a generally available (GA) model. `text-embedding-004` is a stable GA release, making it a more reliable choice for consistent development and potential future use compared to experimental versions that may change or have limitations.\n","3.  **Suitability for RAG Task:** This model is explicitly designed for semantic understanding and tasks like information retrieval and semantic search, which are fundamental to RAG. It also supports optional `task_type` parameters (e.g., `retrieval_document`, `retrieval_query`) that can further optimize embeddings specifically for the document chunking and querying stages of the RAG workflow.\n","\n","In conclusion, `models/text-embedding-004` provides a compelling combination of improved performance over older stable models and greater reliability than experimental versions, making it the most suitable choice for embedding the SBC documents in this RAG application."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"3fbc14cf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T19:45:56.933795Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T19:45:56.933482Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.707479Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.70627Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.781407,"end_time":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.708931","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-18T19:45:56.927524","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["models/embedding-001\n","models/text-embedding-004\n","models/gemini-embedding-exp-03-07\n","models/gemini-embedding-exp\n"]}],"source":["from google import genai\n","from google.genai import types\n","\n","client = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n","\n","for model in client.models.list():\n","  if 'embedContent' in model.supported_actions:\n","    print(model.name)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"604f1c97","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.004919,"end_time":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.719352","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.714433","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Verify Simple Embedding & ChromaDB Write\n","\n","Before ingesting all PDFs, we run a quick “hello world” embedding into a temporary ChromaDB (`./chroma_test_db`) to confirm:\n","\n","1. **Embedding & API connectivity** – that `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` instantiates correctly and your key works.  \n","2. **Filesystem & Chroma write** – that we have write permissions in `/kaggle/working/` and Chroma can persist data.\n","\n","Why this matters:\n","\n","- **Fail‑Fast**: Catch core problems (readonly FS, bad key) in seconds, not minutes into a full ingestion.  \n","- **Environment Sanity**: Kaggle VMs occasionally have stale mounts or quota glitches—this verifies the session is healthy.  \n","- **Cleanliness**: We isolate and then delete `./chroma_test_db`, so our real vector store stays pristine.\n","\n","Once this passes, we confidently proceed to split, embed, and store all SBC PDFs into Chroma.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"2a8fbdfd","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.731703Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.73077Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T19:46:02.130899Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T19:46:02.129969Z"},"papermill":{"duration":3.408293,"end_time":"2025-04-18T19:46:02.132701","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-18T19:45:58.724408","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["🔑 GOOGLE_API_KEY loaded: OK\n","✅ Embedding client initialized.\n","✅ Embed dims: 768\n","✅ Wrote single embedding to ChromaDB at './chroma_test_db', collection 'test_collection'\n","🗑️ Removed temporary ChromaDB directory: ./chroma_test_db\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","import shutil\n","\n","from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings\n","from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\n","\n","def sanity_check_embedding_and_chroma(\n","    api_key: str,\n","    model_name: str = \"models/text-embedding-004\",\n","    test_text: str = \"hello world\",\n","    persist_dir: str = \"./chroma_test_db\",\n","    collection_name: str = \"test_collection\"\n","):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Sanity‑check embeddings and ChromaDB write access:\n","      1.

Chatbot Simulation for Open Enrollment Plan Comparison\n","\n","This section demonstrates how an employee might interact with a benefits chatbot during open enrollment: the system uses our RAG pipeline to extract structured JSON for each plan, then transforms that data into a clear, side‑by‑side comparison table highlighting out‑of‑pocket maxima and other key details so users don’t have to wade through multiple SBC PDFs.\n","\n","**Driving the Comparison**  \n","We first invoke `compare_plans`, which under the hood runs a multi‑query retrieval over all schema‑targeted questions, groups the resulting text chunks by plan, and prompts the LLM to produce clean JSON for each plan. Progress is surfaced with a `tqdm` bar, and any missing out‑of‑network values are replaced with “N/A” to ensure completeness.\n","\n","**Table Assembly & Styling**  \n","Next, we map each JSON field into human‑readable rows—plan name, HSA availability, in‑ and out‑of‑network out‑of‑pocket maxima, exclusions, and coverage dates—then build a Pandas DataFrame with plans as columns. We strip file extensions, convert booleans to “Yes”/“No,” normalize dates, and apply centered styling plus a bold caption to produce an employee‑friendly table right in the notebook.\n","\n","**Chatbot Session Simulation**  \n","Finally, a simple `main()` function ties it all together: we initialize the embedder, store, and LLM with slightly relaxed sampling parameters (temperature, top_p, top_k), echo a simulated user request, print a friendly “Let me look into that for you…” response, and render the styled comparison table—just like a live chatbot session.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"51585539","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T19:46:18.539904Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T19:46:18.539592Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T19:46:28.565962Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T19:46:28.564681Z"},"papermill":{"duration":10.036156,"end_time":"2025-04-18T19:46:28.567748","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-18T19:46:18.531592","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["🔑
